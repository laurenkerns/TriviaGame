# TriviaGame
Homework 5// Option 1
What this application does:
"Totally Trivial Trivia!!"
>This application gives a user multiple choice questions
>each question is timmed, and the user has a limited time to finish the quiz
>if a user runs out of time, the game will end
>once the game ends, the page will revel the number of questions a user got correctly and incorrectly

RULES:
> a user can only choose a question once
>if the timer runs out the game will end 


Why this project is usful:
>Javascript is hard! I want and need all the practice I can get, this assignment will help with more JS application, as well as more practive with HTML & CSS. We have also learned about timers- which is one of the biggest componets to this game. 

How to get started:
>What I have recently learned on how to get started is the write out (in puesdocode) first, and then tackle each section one by one. If you look at this project as a whole- it is very VERY overwhelming. By breaking it up, it makes it a little less intimdating.

I am the only one maintaing and contributing to this project. If a user needs help with this project- I suggest asking a TA, I'm still learning ha!
